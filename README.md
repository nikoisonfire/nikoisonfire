# Hi there! 👋

I'm Nikola, a developer from Germany. My programming journey started at age 12 when I was reading "Java for Dummies" in the library. Admittedly, I could only grasp the basics, but a lifelong passion was born. Since then my journey has lead me from web development in PHP to Android apps in Java, until I eventually settled on JavaScript a few years ago. 

I used to be a shy programmer, so most of the stuff I built in the past is private. 

But I want to evolve as a developer so here goes my open-source journey.

Hop on! 🚂

Why not stay for a cup of coffee? ☕️
